As a dedicated and detail-oriented cybersecurity professional, I bring a strong foundation in IT with a focus on asset security and identity and access management (IAM). 
My passion lies in protecting digital environments, analyzing data, and identifying vulnerabilities to strengthen organizational defenses.
With a commitment to continuous growth, I am actively honing my skills in programming, time management, and both written and verbal communicationâ€”essential tools for navigating the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity.

My experience in managing user roles and securing assets during onboarding processes has equipped me with practical insights into safeguarding sensitive information.
I am particularly drawn to the investigative and preventative aspects of cybersecurity, where data analysis plays a critical role in uncovering threats and reinforcing system integrity.

I aim to contribute to organizations by aligning my technical strengths and core values with their security goals.
Whether it's enhancing IAM protocols or supporting incident response efforts, I am driven by a mission to protect people and systems through proactive and intelligent security practices.
I look forward to bringing this dedication to cybersecurity recruiters and organizations seeking professionals who are both technically capable and deeply committed to the mission of digital protection.
